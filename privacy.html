        <h2>What data do you collect & how do you use the data?</h2>
        <p>
          When you invite Giveaway Bot to your server, we cache the guild object
          and channel objects. Additionally, we may also cache any user or
          member objects that Discord provides. Upon interaction with the bot,
          we may also cache your member and user objects if we do not already do
          so. We store this data solely for operation of the Giveaway service to
          prevent excessive API requests to the Discord API.

          We are happy to resolve any data processing of security concerns you
          may have. The best way to get in contact with us is by joining our
          <a href="https://discord.gg/nTzWG2etMz">Discord support server</a> and

        <h2>How can I request my data or data removal?</h2>
        <p>
          Please join our
          <a href="https://discord.gg/nTzWG2etMz">Discord support server</a> and
          open a Ticket in the #support channel. Unfortunately, we are unable to
          help you with these queries via external channels, as we would not be
          able to reliably verify your identity. We will handle your request
          within 30 days of it being logged.
